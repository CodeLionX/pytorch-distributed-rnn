# --------- Helper Methods --------------------

# On the local node, call a method with first arg as the value held by the
# RRef. Other args are passed in as arguments to the function called.
# Useful for calling instance methods. method could be any matching function, including
# class methods.
def call_method(method, rref, *args, **kwargs):
    return method(rref.local_value(), *args, **kwargs)


# Given an RRef, return the result of calling the passed in method on the value
# held by the RRef. This call is done on the remote node that owns
# the RRef and passes along the given argument.
# Example: If the value held by the RRef is of type Foo, then
# remote_method(Foo.bar, rref, arg1, arg2) is equivalent to calling
# <foo_instance>.bar(arg1, arg2) on the remote node and getting the result
# back.

    args = [method, rref] + list(args)
